Prerequisite:

Step 1: Install Docker
    1. Command to see your active container: docker ps

Step 2: Install Redis
    1. Open your terminal or PowerShell and run this command: 
        docker run -d --name EchoStream -p 6379:6379 redis:latest (This starts a Redis server in the background, on the correct port (6379), and it will restart automatically.)
    2. To check if it's working: Open a new terminal and type redis-cli ping. If it replies with PONG, you are ready.

Step 3: Set Up Python & Install Packages:
    1. Navigate into your project folder: cd EchoStream
    2. Create a virtual environment (named venv): python3 -n venv venv
    3. Activate venv: source venv/bin/activate
    4. Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Run the server:
    1. Make sure your Redis server is running (from Step 1).
    2. Make sure your virtual environment is active (from Step 3).
    3. Start the server: python3 server.py

Commands: 
    1. Start the Docker Service: sudo systemctl start docker
    2. Docker to start automatically when the computer boots: sudo systemctl enable docker
    3. Check that it's running with systemctl status docker: 

    4. Start the Redis Container:
        * This is the command that uses Docker to download and run your Redis database. You only need to do this once: docker run -d --name EchoStream -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
        * If you get an error that the name vidsync-redis is already in use, it means an old container exists. Remove it first with docker rm vidsync-redis and then run the command again.

    5. Verify Everything: docker ps (You should see EchoStream in the list)

    6. Allow Port 5000 Through Your Firewall: sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp



---------------------------------------------------------------------------

sudo systemctl start docker
Start your Redis container: (This downloads and runs Redis. You only need to run this once ever on this machine.)

If you run this again, it will say EchoStream already exists. That's fine. You can check if it's running with docker ps.
    docker run -d --name EchoStream -p 6379:6379 redis:latest

Create a Python Virtual Environment: (This creates a private venv folder for your packages. You only do this once.)
    python3 -m venv venv

python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment: (You must do this every time you open a new terminal.)

Your terminal prompt will change to show (venv).
    source venv/bin/activate

Install the Python Packages: (This reads requirements.txt and installs Flask, SocketIO, etc. into your venv.)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
